My First Projects

Hi Humans!

This is my first time in this world! I'm learning about GitHub. Currently I started my studies as a developer in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Phyton and other languages. I live in Brazil and here I have several friends who are working in this area. I hope to absorb the knowledge necessary to develop my first projects.
